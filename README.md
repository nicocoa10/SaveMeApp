# SaveMe
SaveMe Android Application repository.

SaveMe is an application that aims to be an alternative to the contacts application that is on all modern phones. SaveMe differs from the regular contacts application by including a QR code generator and QR code scanner. The inclusion of these features was decided up when one of our members of our development team was complaining about how he kept losing friends he had made when he went to concerts. This was due to concerts usually being held in an area with poor moblie service. We wanted a way for them to exchange information without dealing with typing it on each others phones, being unable to hear each others information due the background noise of the concert, and avoid dealing with poor internet service.

The main features of SaveMe are,
          
    1. Store any contact information that the user sets up
    2. The ability to obtain information from another user
    3. The use of a QR code generator to create a code that another user can scan to get the users information
    4. The use of a QR code scanner that allows the app to obtain information from other users QR codes
