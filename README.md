# SaveMeApp
SaveMe Android Application repository.

The SaveMeApp is an application that aims to be an alternative to the contacts application that is on all modern phones. The SaveMeApp differs from the regular contacts application by including a QR code generator and QR code scanner. The inclusion of these features was decided up when one of our members of our development team was complaining about how he kept losing friends he had made when he went to concerts due to them usually being in an area with poor service.
