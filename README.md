# SaveMeApp
SaveMe Android Application repository.

The SaveMeApp is an application that aims to be an alternative to the contacts application that is on all modern phones. The SaveMeApp differs from the regular contacts application by including a QR code generator and QR code scanner. The inclusion of these features was decided up when one of our members of our development team was complaining about how he kept losing friends he had made when he went to concerts. This was due to concerts usually being held in an area with poor moblie service. We wanted a way for them to exchange information without dealing with typing it on each others phones and being unable to hear each others information due the background noise of the concert.
